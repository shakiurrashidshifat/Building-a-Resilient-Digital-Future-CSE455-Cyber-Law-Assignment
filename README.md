### 1. Introduction
Bangladesh is undergoing a rapid digital transformation, integrating technology into key sectors such as finance, education, governance, and commerce. The “Digital Bangladesh” initiative has accelerated internet usage, mobile connectivity, and e-governance, making cyberspace a critical national asset.

However, this shift has also led to a rise in cyber threats, including data breaches, online fraud, identity theft, and misinformation. Current cyber laws, primarily the ICT Act 2006 and the Digital Security Act 2018, are increasingly seen as outdated or overly broad, lacking alignment with international standards and technological advancements.

This assignment aims to analyze the current cyber law framework in Bangladesh, compare it with global best practices, and propose specific legal reforms. The goal is to develop a more secure, rights-based, and future-ready legal foundation for the country’s digital landscape.

### 2. Current Cyber Law Framework in Bangladesh
Bangladesh’s cyber legal infrastructure is still in its developing stage. With the country embracing a “Digital Bangladesh” vision, the necessity of a robust legal framework to safeguard digital operations, online rights, and technological innovations is more critical than ever. At present, two major legislations constitute the backbone of Bangladesh’s cyber laws: the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006 and the Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018. Each of these laws carries specific objectives, strengths, and notable shortcomings that require critical evaluation and reform to meet the growing demands of cyberspace governance.

#### 2.1 ICT Act 2006
The ICT Act was a pioneering step for Bangladesh in regulating digital activity. Enacted in 2006, this law aimed to address a broad range of issues including e-commerce, electronic records, and cybercrimes such as hacking, identity theft, and data manipulation. It was considered a major legislative move at the time, especially when digital infrastructure was still developing.

However, the ICT Act now appears outdated in light of the rapid advancement of technology and evolving nature of cyber threats. It contains several provisions that have become redundant or conflict with newer laws. For instance, certain offenses that are now more comprehensively addressed in the Digital Security Act were initially included in the ICT Act, leading to overlapping legal authority and confusion in enforcement. Furthermore, the penalties and enforcement procedures outlined in the ICT Act are often criticized for being ambiguous or insufficient in deterring modern cybercriminals.

In practice, the ICT Act is now used less frequently for prosecuting digital crimes, with the DSA 2018 becoming the primary statute in recent years.

#### 2.2 Digital Security Act (DSA) 2018
To replace and expand upon several elements of the ICT Act, the Digital Security Act, 2018 was introduced. It was designed to respond to more contemporary issues such as online defamation, cyberterrorism, digital fraud, hacking, and threats to national security. The act provides detailed definitions and penalties for various types of cyber offenses and grants significant investigative authority to law enforcement agencies.

Some of the key provisions of the DSA include:

* Criminalization of publishing or transmitting defamatory, false, or obscene information online.

* Punishment for unauthorized access to information systems or critical digital infrastructure.

* Penalties for cyberstalking, identity theft, and spreading propaganda against the state.

Despite its broader scope, the DSA has faced significant criticism, particularly from human rights groups, journalists, and digital activists. A major point of contention is its vague language — terms like “defamatory” or “anti-state activities” are not clearly defined, leaving them open to broad interpretation. This has led to fears that the law may be misused to suppress freedom of expression, dissent, and journalistic activities.

The act also allows authorities to make arrests without a warrant in certain cases, raising concerns over abuse of power and lack of judicial oversight. Numerous reports indicate that the law has been used disproportionately against critics of the government or individuals expressing dissent on social media platforms.

#### 2.3 Key Issues in Bangladesh’s Cyber Law Landscape
Although Bangladesh has made commendable efforts to introduce cyber-specific legislation, several critical gaps remain:

*  Lack of Data Privacy Protection
One of the most glaring omissions in Bangladesh’s cyber law framework is the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Unlike the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Bangladesh does not have a regulatory mechanism that gives citizens control over how their personal data is collected, stored, and used. Both the ICT Act and the DSA lack strong provisions for ensuring digital privacy. This is especially concerning in the age of widespread data collection by both government and private entities.

* No Legal Recognition of Ethical Hacking
Cybersecurity research and ethical hacking are crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in digital systems before they can be exploited by malicious hackers. However, in Bangladesh, there is no legal framework that acknowledges or protects ethical hackers. As a result, professionals who work to improve digital security may be penalized under existing laws. Encouraging responsible disclosure through legal protection and incentives is essential to strengthening national cyber defense.

* Weak Enforcement and Technical Capacity
While the DSA gives extensive powers to law enforcement, the lack of trained cybercrime investigators, forensic analysts, and technical infrastructure hinders the effective implementation of these laws. Many law enforcement agencies lack the resources or expertise needed to investigate complex digital crimes. This results in either delayed justice or misuse of the law in less technical but high-profile cases.

* Overlapping Provisions and Legal Ambiguity
The overlap between the ICT Act and the DSA creates confusion regarding jurisdiction, leading to inefficiencies in case handling and prosecution. In several cases, law enforcement agencies have filed charges under both laws for a single offense, creating procedural complications.

* Public Awareness and Digital Literacy
Another pressing issue is the low level of public awareness regarding digital rights and legal protections. Many citizens are unaware of what constitutes a cybercrime or how to report it. Moreover, the lack of digital literacy makes users vulnerable to scams, phishing, and online harassment, which are often not reported or addressed due to the complexity of the legal process.
